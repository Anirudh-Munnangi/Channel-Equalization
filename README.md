Channel-Equalization
====================

Algorithms to tackle the side effects of channel during signal communication

The general process of communication involves a sender to channel to reciver setup. It may look simple at a first glance
but it is indeed a complex process. The channel is supposedly the necessary evil associated in the process of communication.
There are a lot of strategies developed to deal with the negative effects of channel imposed on the main signal and these 
are the ways which help us gain the original signal back so that an effective communication link can be established.

This repository has only few basic versions of the algorithms and their related code. All code is in MATLAB.
